Usability is a key factor to ensure computer systems can be used in an efficient and pleasing way. Accessibility is part of this, but creating accessible software does not necessarily
mean that usability is reached to its maximum.
In the specific context of adult education in IT, people with a visual impairment (VI) use screen magnifiers. These magnify the screen in different ways, but the computer system is still
controlled using a mouse and keyboard. Even more specifically, people with multiple disabilities and visual impairment (MDVI) very often are not able to use the mouse and keyboard
and need to rely on special hardware. In addition, people with a cortical visual impairment (CVI) are struggling to use computer hardware for different reasons. (e.g.: hand-eye
coordination).
Since eye-tracking systems have become more accurate and affordable, computer systems can be used and controlled using these systems. However, they are developed for people
without any special needs. This project tackles this issue by selecting one or more eye tracking systems which are commercially available. The different partners select these using
different criteria, and the adjust them to be used by people with VI, MDVI and CVI.
After adjusting the eye-tracking system to the specific needs, applications that are specifically intended to be used by an eye-tracking system for people with MDVI and CVI are
developed. (e.g. communication software with bigger buttons). Even though these are developed for people with MDVI, multiple disabled people without a visual impairment will also
be able to use this software using an eye-tracking system. These applications will help the target audience to increase their use of computer systems and help them in their daily tasks.
In addition, since professionals working with the target audience, the application will also include aspects which will help them to deliver a better quality of work for their clients and
students.
The participants organisations in this project all work in the field of visual impairment. Slovenia an Italy are experts in the field of VI, MDVI and CVI. Luxembourg and Spain provide the
experts in developing the applications and adjusting the eye-tracking solutions to the specific needs.
In addition to the application, a survey about eye-tracking solutions with their advantages and disadvantages, in regards with VI, are stated. In addition a user documentation for the
use of the software will be elaborated as well as a developer documentation for software developers who want to adapt the applications to their specific needs.
At the first meeting, the milestones will be established and then divided into several minor milestones which again will be divided into individual tasks. Each task is assigned to one ore
more persons, and a GANTT chart is created in order to visualize the different tasks with their according milestones and deadlines.The team is managed by a modern agile approach,
which allows to swift adaptations during the development process.
In total, there will be 5 transnational meetings, in which the major milestones will be discussed and evaluated. In addition to these, each month will be an online meeting in order to
track process and to receive feedback on the different tasks. This will ensure that a quick response to all the different issues that have arisen will be given by common agreement of all
the partners.
The results will be published on different platforms, among which is the project's website, e-Twinning platform and GitHub. GitHub is a open source development platform for software
applications.
